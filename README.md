# E-Commerce App

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

## Description

The app development was to modify the starter code to create an application called E-Commerce App. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Insonmia is used for the GET for categories, products or tags. The data is displayed in a formatted JSON. You can create, update, and delete data in the database by using API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
