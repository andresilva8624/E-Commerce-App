## Acceptance Criteria

<hr>
<li>GIVEN a functional Express.js API</li>
<li>WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize</li>
<li>WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data</li>
<li>WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database</li>
<li>WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON</li>
<li>WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database</li>

Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need to use the MySQL2Links to an external site. and SequelizeLinks to an external site. packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv packageLinks to an external site. to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Database Models
Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

Category

id

Integer

Doesn't allow null values

Set as primary key

Uses auto increment

category_name

String

Doesn't allow null values

Product

id

Integer

Doesn't allow null values

Set as primary key

Uses auto increment

product_name

String

Doesn't allow null values

price

Decimal

Doesn't allow null values

Validates that the value is a decimal

stock

Integer

Doesn't allow null values

Set a default value of 10

Validates that the value is numeric

category_id

Integer

References the category model's id

Tag

id

Integer

Doesn't allow null values

Set as primary key

Uses auto increment

tag_name

String

ProductTag

id

Integer

Doesn't allow null values

Set as primary key

Uses auto increment

product_id

Integer

References the product model's id

tag_id

Integer

References the tag model's id

Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

Category has many Product models.

Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

Tag belongs to many Product models.

HINT
Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations
Fill out the unfinished routes in product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

NOTE
The functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products is already done for you.

HINT
Seed the Database
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start
Create the code needed in server.js to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
