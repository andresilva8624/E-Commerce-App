# E-Commerce App

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

## Description

The app development was to modify the starter code to create an application called E-Commerce App. You’ll need to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Insonmia is used for the GET for categories, products or tags. The data is displayed in a formatted JSON. You can create, update, and delete data in the database by using API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
Enjoy! 😀

## Installation
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Clone the repository to your local machine and open the server.js on your Terminal with Node.js
